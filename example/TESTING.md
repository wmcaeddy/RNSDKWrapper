## Regression Tests

After any code changes, run:

- [ ] TC-201: Basic face capture
- [ ] TC-301: Basic liveness
- [ ] TC-401: Basic face match
- [ ] TC-501: Full workflow

## Notes

- **Expected Failures**: Some test cases are designed to trigger errors (e.g., invalid credentials, permission denied). These should fail gracefully with clear error messages.
- **Test Environment**: Some tests require specific conditions (network off, permissions denied, etc.). Document your test environment.
- **Device Coverage**: Test on at least one iOS device and one Android device. Emulators/simulators are acceptable for most tests but real devices for camera testing.
